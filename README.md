# AI Open Guidelines

Community Driven Guidelines for Building Human Centered AI Software


## How to Contribute

The structure of guidelines is determined in [mkdocs.yml](/mkdocs.yml), and the text of the guidelines in the respective categories can be found in the [docs](/docs) folder. Feel free to submit PR's to change any of these, adding, removing, or editing the guidlines to become more clear and usefull. The general philosophy here being that we do not need these guidelines to fit within a single narrative or cohesive format but rather to be a comparativly compresinsive list of things to keep in mind and consider when buidling AI products.
