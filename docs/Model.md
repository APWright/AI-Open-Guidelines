# Model

## Training Data

- Review how often your data sources are refreshed
- Collect live data from users
- Provide easy access to labels
- Translate user needs into data needs
- Only introduce new features when needed
- Identify your data sources
- Identify any outliers, and investigate whether they are actual outliers
  or due to errors in the data
- Source your data responsibly
- Design for raters and labeling
- Split your data
- Let raters change their minds
- Evaluate rater tools
- Consider missing or incomplete data
- Consider unexpected input
- Investigate rater context and incentives
- Articulate your data sources
- Beware of confirmation bias

## Training Procedure

- Design for experimentation
- Inspect the features possible values, units, and data types
- Evaluate the reward function outcomes
- Weigh false positive & negative
- Consider precision and recall tradeoffs
- Balance underfitting and overfitting
- Tune your model
- Map existing workflows
- Design and evaluate the reward function
- Design for model tuning
